Car Med: A car maintenance and overall car health management dashboard

We are making a car health app with maintenance notifications

Users create and account and login and input their make, model, and mileage

Then a dashboard is loaded with their various car health such as oil change life 

Everytime a user logs into the app, they are asked what their car mileage is and the dashboard is updated 

When it is time for an oil change, a user is notified that they need to get an oil change completed 

When the user clicks the notification they are brought into the platform and given two buttons: "Do Myself" and "Have it done"

If the user clicks "Do Myself" then they are given 3 videos via the Youtube API on how to complete the task for their specific car

If the user clicks "Have it Done" the Google Maps API is called for the closest car shops in the area along with their address and rating and shows each location on a map

Thanks for looking at Car Med!
